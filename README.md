# URL Shortener

This is a simple URL shortener app created to understand how shorteners work (based on [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/mongodb-node-express-project/) really funny article).

I took some inspiration from some [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) articles but made all te code and project architecture using patterns that I like and have learned before.

## Technologies

The project was created mainly using the `shortid, Typescript` and `Express` libraries.

The `shortid` lib itself make all the shortening automatically, so everything I need to made was create the routers and handle the URL creation entities and logic.

## Running the project

To run the project, simply open its folder in the terminal and type the following commands:

```bash
> yarn
> yarn run dev
```

## Future

I will probably use this project in another future projects or applications (that I already have an idea), so it will be hosted somewhere (Heroku, I guess) and I will create some production ready code. But, actually, the project only runs in developer mode.
